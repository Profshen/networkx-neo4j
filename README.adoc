= networkx-neo4j

This library provides NetworkX API for https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-graph-algorithms[Neo4j Graph Algorithms^].
You should be able to use it as you would NetworkX but algorithms will run against Neo4j r

== Installation

I haven't deployed this yet but you can still install using pip directly from the repo.

[source, bash]
----
pip install git+https://github.com/neo4j-graph-analytics/networkx-neo4j.git
----

== Usage

And here's how you use it:

[source, python]
----
import nxneo4j
import os
from neo4j.v1 import GraphDatabase, basic_auth

user_name = os.environ.get("NEO4J_USER", "neo4j")
password = os.environ.get("NEO4J_PASSWORD", "neo")

driver = GraphDatabase.driver("bolt://localhost", auth=basic_auth(user_name, password))
G = nxneo4j.Graph(driver)
----

We can create a little graph:

----
G.add_node(1)
G.add_nodes_from([2, 3])

G.add_edge(1, 2)
G.add_edge(4, 5)
G.add_edges_from([(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3)])
----

And run algorithms against it:

----
>>> list(nxneo4j.community.label_propagation_communities(G))
[{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5}]
